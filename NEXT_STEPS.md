# Next Steps to Complete v1.0.0 Branch Creation

## Current Status
✅ **Completed:**
- Unshallowed the repository to get full commit history
- Verified commit `bc9bb59008f514bdb6059b4cd04d84bcbe1bfe9b` exists
- Created `v1.0.0` branch locally pointing to the target commit
- Created GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/create-v1-branch.yml`)
- Created shell script (`create-v1-branch.sh`)
- Created comprehensive documentation (`V1_BRANCH_README.md`)

⏳ **Pending:**
- Push `v1.0.0` branch to origin (requires manual action)

## Why Manual Action is Needed
The `v1.0.0` branch has been created locally but cannot be pushed automatically due to:
1. Limited credentials in the Copilot workspace environment
2. Git push commands require GitHub authentication
3. The `report_progress` tool only pushes changes to the current PR branch

## How to Complete the Task

### Option 1: Merge This PR and Run the GitHub Actions Workflow (Recommended)
1. **Merge this PR** to add the workflow, script, and documentation to the repository
2. **Go to GitHub Actions**:
   - Navigate to https://github.com/k9barry/8800SX/actions
   - Select "Create v1.0.0 Branch" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow"
   - Select branch (usually `main`)
   - Click "Run workflow" button
3. **Verify**: Check that `v1.0.0` branch appears in the branch list

### Option 2: Run the Shell Script Locally
If you have local repository access with push permissions:
```bash
# Clone or update your local repository
git clone https://github.com/k9barry/8800SX.git
cd 8800SX

# Merge or pull changes from this PR
git pull origin copilot/populate-v1-0-0-from-commit

# Run the script
./create-v1-branch.sh
```

### Option 3: Manual Git Commands
If you prefer direct control:
```bash
git fetch --unshallow --all --tags
git branch v1.0.0 bc9bb59008f514bdb6059b4cd04d84bcbe1bfe9b
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Verification
After the branch is pushed, verify with:
```bash
git fetch origin
git log --oneline origin/v1.0.0 -1
```

Expected output:
```
bc9bb59 Created index.php to redirect and changed target to _self
```

Or check on GitHub:
