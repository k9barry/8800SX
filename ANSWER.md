# Answer to Your Question

## Your Question:
> "I think we are creating a packaged container for the viavi-web. If we are do I need the build Dockerfile in the docker-compose or do I just need to pull the github repository image?"

## Short Answer:

**YES, you are creating packaged containers!** 🎉

**For Production:** You do NOT need the build Dockerfile in docker-compose. Just pull the pre-built image from GitHub Container Registry using `docker-compose.prod.yml`.

**For Development:** Keep the build Dockerfile in docker-compose for local testing and changes.

---

## Detailed Explanation:

### What's Happening Now:

Your GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/docker-build.yml`) automatically:
1. ✅ Builds the Docker image for viavi-web
2. ✅ Pushes it to `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx`
3. ✅ Tags it with version numbers and branch names
4. ✅ Makes it publicly available

### Your Two Options:

#### ✅ Option 1: Production (Recommended - Use Pre-built Image)

**File:** `docker-compose.prod.yml`

**Command:**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**What it does:**
- Pulls `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:main-web` from GitHub Container Registry
- NO build step required
- NO Dockerfile needed on server
- Faster deployment (1-2 minutes vs 5-10 minutes)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  viavi-web:
    image: ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:main-web  # ← Pulls from registry
```

**Files needed on production server:**
- ✅ `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- ✅ `.env` (with your passwords)
- ✅ `data/init-db.sql`
- ❌ Dockerfile (NOT needed!)
- ❌ Source code (NOT needed!)

---

#### 🔧 Option 2: Development (Build from Source)

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

**Command:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**What it does:**
- Builds image locally from Dockerfile
- Requires Dockerfile and all source code
- Longer build time (5-10 minutes)
- Good for testing changes

**Configuration:**
```yaml
services:
  viavi-web:
    build:              # ← Builds locally
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

**Files needed:**
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml`
- ✅ `.env`
- ✅ `Dockerfile`
- ✅ All source code in `data/`

---

## Recommendation:

### For Production Servers:
```bash
# Use the pre-built image
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Benefits:**
- ⚡ Faster (no build time)
- 🎯 Consistent (tested in CI/CD)
- 💾 Less disk space during deployment
- 🔄 Easy updates (`docker compose pull`)
- 📌 Version pinning (use `3.0.1-web` tag)

### For Development:
```bash
# Build from source
docker compose up -d
```

**Benefits:**
- 🛠️ Test changes immediately
- 🎨 Customize freely
- 📝 No external dependencies

## Available Images:

Your CI/CD is already publishing images to GitHub Container Registry:

| Tag | Image | Use Case |
|-----|-------|----------|
| Latest dev | `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:main-web` | Development |
| Stable version | `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:3.0.1-web` | Production (recommended) |
| Minor version | `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:3.0-web` | Auto-update patches |
| Major version | `ghcr.io/k9barry/8800sx:3-web` | Auto-update minor |

---

## How to Switch:

### Currently (Your Setup):
Your `docker-compose.yml` has the `build:` section, so it builds locally.

### To Use Pre-built Images:

**Method 1: Use separate file (Recommended)**
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

**Method 2: Edit docker-compose.yml**
Comment out the `build:` section and uncomment the `image:` line (instructions are in the file).

## Summary:

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Are you creating packaged containers? | ✅ YES! |
| Do you need Dockerfile in docker-compose for production? | ❌ NO! Use docker-compose.prod.yml instead |
| Should you pull from GitHub registry? | ✅ YES for production! |
| What's the advantage? | Faster, consistent, easier updates |
| Can you still build locally? | ✅ YES! Use docker-compose.yml for development |

---

## Next Steps:

1. **For Production Deployment:**
   ```bash
   # Clone only what you need
   git clone https://github.com/k9barry/8800SX.git
   cd 8800SX
   
   # Configure
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Set your DB_PASSWORD
   
   # Deploy with pre-built image
   docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
   ```

2. **For Development:**
   ```bash
   # Use standard compose file
   docker compose up -d
   ```
