## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
- Branch created locally
- Automation tools ready
- Documentation complete
- All tools tested and verified

### ⏳ Pending
- Push `v1.0.0` branch to remote repository

### Why Push is Pending
The branch cannot be pushed automatically because:
1. The Copilot workspace has limited GitHub credentials
2. Git push commands require authentication that is not available in this environment
3. The `report_progress` tool only pushes to the current PR branch, not arbitrary branches
4. This is by design - following the principle of least privilege

## How to Complete

### Recommended: Use GitHub Actions Workflow
After this PR is merged:
1. Go to GitHub Actions in the repository
2. Find "Create v1.0.0 Branch" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. The branch will be created and pushed automatically

### Alternative: Run Shell Script
With local repository access:
```bash
./create-v1-branch.sh
```

### Manual: Git Commands
```bash
git fetch --unshallow --all --tags
git branch v1.0.0 bc9bb59008f514bdb6059b4cd04d84bcbe1bfe9b
git push origin v1.0.0
```

## Verification
Once pushed, the branch can be verified at:
- URL: https://github.com/k9barry/8800SX/tree/v1.0.0
- Command: `git ls-remote --heads origin v1.0.0`
- Expected: Should show commit `bc9bb59008f514bdb6059b4cd04d84bcbe1bfe9b`
