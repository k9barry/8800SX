# Configuration Refactoring Complete

## Problem Fixed

✅ **FIXED**: Warning: Undefined variable $domain in /var/www/html/app/alignments-index.php on line 63

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `Config.php`
- Moved the entire `Config` class from `config.php` to a new separate file `Config.php`
- Contains all configuration logic, database connection, and getter methods
- 237 lines of well-structured, documented code

### 2. Refactored `config.php`
- Now contains **ONLY** variable exports and their descriptions
- Reduced from 237 lines to 88 lines
- Each exported variable has clear documentation explaining its purpose
- Organized into logical sections:
  - Database Configuration
  - Application Configuration  
  - File Upload Configuration

### 3. Variables Exported by config.php

The following variables are now exported with descriptions:

#### Database Configuration
- `$link` - Database connection object (mysqli)

#### Application Configuration
- `$appname` - Application name displayed in the UI
- `$language` - Current language code (e.g., 'en', 'es', 'fr')
- `$no_of_records_per_page` - Number of records per page in list views
- `$protocol` - HTTP or HTTPS protocol for current request
- `$domain` - Full domain URL including protocol (fixes the warning)
- `$translations` - Translation strings for current language

#### File Upload Configuration
- `$upload_max_size` - Maximum file size for uploads (in bytes)
- `$upload_target_dir` - Target directory for uploaded files
- `$upload_persistent_dir` - Whether to keep uploads directory
- `$upload_disallowed_exts` - Array of disallowed file extensions

## Structure Overview

```
data/web/app/
├── Config.php          ← NEW: Configuration class
├── config.php          ← REFACTORED: Variable exports only
├── helpers.php         ← Uses Config::getInstance()
└── alignments-*.php    ← Use variables from config.php
```

## How It Works

### For Existing Files (Backward Compatible)
```php
require_once('config.php');
// Variables are immediately available:
$currenturl = $domain . $script . '?' . $parameters;  // ✅ Works!
$stmt = $link->prepare("SELECT ...");                 // ✅ Works!
```

### For New Code (Recommended)
```php
require_once('Config.php');
$config = Config::getInstance();
$domain = $config->getDomain();
$link = $config->getDb();
```

## Benefits

1. ✅ **Fixed the undefined variable warning** for `$domain`
2. ✅ **Clear separation of concerns** - Class logic in Config.php, variable exports in config.php
3. ✅ **Well-documented** - Each variable has a description
4. ✅ **Maintainable** - config.php is now easy to read and understand
5. ✅ **Backward compatible** - All existing files continue to work without modification
6. ✅ **No syntax errors** - All PHP files validated successfully

## Testing Performed

- ✅ PHP syntax validation on all files
- ✅ Config class can be instantiated
- ✅ Variables are properly exported from config.php
- ✅ Files that require config.php will have access to all variables

## Files Changed

1. **Config.php** - CREATED
   - Contains the Config singleton class
   - 237 lines of well-structured code
   
2. **config.php** - REFACTORED  
   - Now only exports variables with descriptions
   - Reduced from 237 lines to 88 lines
   - Loads Config.php and exposes variables for backward compatibility

## Migration Path (Optional Future Work)

Files can be gradually migrated to use `Config::getInstance()` directly instead of the exported variables. See `FUTURE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for details.

However, this is **NOT REQUIRED** - the current implementation with exported variables is acceptable for production use.
