and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.0.4] - 2025-10-13

### Automate CHANGELOG updates with PR title and description for every release

## Overview

This PR updates the semantic versioning workflow to automatically populate the CHANGELOG with PR title and description for every release, eliminating the need for manual [Unreleased] section management.

## Problem

The previous workflow required contributors to manually edit the CHANGELOG.md file by adding changes to an [Unreleased] section. This approach had several issues:
- Manual CHANGELOG editing created merge conflicts
- Inconsistent formatting across entries
- Extra maintenance overhead for contributors
- Risk of forgetting to document changes

## Solution

The workflow now automatically extracts the PR title and description when a PR is merged to main, and uses this information to create properly formatted CHANGELOG entries and GitHub releases.

### Workflow Changes

**Before:**
```markdown
## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Feature manually added by contributor
```
Workflow would move this to a version section on release.

**After:**
The workflow now:
1. Extracts PR title and description using GitHub CLI
2. Creates a new version section directly: `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Uses PR title as the heading: `### <PR Title>`
4. Includes PR description as the content
5. Updates version comparison links automatically

### File Changes

**`.github/workflows/semantic-versioning.yml`**
- Added "Get PR details" step to extract PR information
- Modified CHANGELOG update logic to insert version sections with PR content
- Simplified release creation using echo commands for proper variable expansion
- Removed dependency on [Unreleased] section

**`CHANGELOG.md`**
- Removed `## [Unreleased]` section
- Removed `[Unreleased]` version comparison link
- Updated documentation for contributors: document changes in PR descriptions instead of CHANGELOG
- Updated maintainer documentation to reflect fully automated process

**`.github/copilot-instructions.md`**
- Updated semantic versioning workflow documentation
- Added emphasis on writing clear, descriptive PR titles and descriptions
- Removed references to manual [Unreleased] section management

## Benefits

âœ… **Zero manual CHANGELOG maintenance** - Contributors only write PR descriptions  
âœ… **No merge conflicts** - CHANGELOG is only modified by automated workflow  
âœ… **Consistent formatting** - All entries follow the same structure  
âœ… **Better documentation** - PR descriptions are more detailed since they become the changelog  
âœ… **Improved code reviews** - Better PR descriptions lead to better review discussions  
âœ… **Complete automation** - Every release is properly documented with date and description  

## Usage

Contributors should now write clear, descriptive PR titles and descriptions using these categories:
- **Added** - new features
- **Changed** - changes to existing functionality
- **Deprecated** - soon-to-be removed features
- **Removed** - removed features
- **Fixed** - bug fixes
- **Security** - security fixes

The PR description becomes the changelog entry, so quality matters!

## Testing

- âœ… YAML syntax validated with Python yaml parser
- âœ… Created test script simulating CHANGELOG updates with sample PR data
- âœ… Verified correct version insertion and link generation
- âœ… Code review completed with no issues
- âœ… End-to-end workflow logic verified

## Breaking Change

This is a workflow breaking change:
- No more [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG.md
- Contributors must adapt to documenting changes in PR descriptions
- Existing changelog entries remain unchanged
- Only future releases use the new format

<summary>Original prompt</summary>

> Made it so that every patch, minor or major release causes the CHANGELOG to be updated with the date of the release and the title and description of the PR merge.  make sure the CHANGELOG has a release section for every release version and there is no need for the unreleased section then.
